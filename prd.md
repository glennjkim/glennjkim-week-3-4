# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction
**Context:**  
Fraud continues to rise in eCommerce and digital payments. While businesses have fraud detection engines, many lack a transparent, real-time interface that empowers analysts to monitor suspicious transactions and act quickly.

**Vision:**  
Develop a web-based Fraud Monitoring Dashboard that provides analysts and managers with real-time visibility into suspicious activity, streamlined triage tools, and clear reporting.

**Problem Statement:**  
Existing fraud detection tools are either too slow, too opaque, or too rigid, leading to missed fraud attempts and wasted analyst time. A tailored dashboard will close this gap.

**Goals:**  
- Enable fraud analysts to detect and act on suspicious transactions faster.  
- Reduce false positives and false negatives through improved visibility.  
- Provide fraud managers with insights into fraud patterns and case resolution trends.  

**Link to Strategy:**  
Supports the broader organizational goal of reducing fraud losses, increasing trust in the platform, and improving operational efficiency for fraud teams.

## 2. Objectives & Success Metrics
- **Detection Effectiveness:** Identify at least 80% of high-risk fraud attempts before fulfillment.  
- **Efficiency:** Reduce average triage time per case from 12 minutes to under 5 minutes.  
- **Accuracy:** Reduce false positives by 20% within 6 months.  
- **Adoption:** 90% of fraud analysts using the dashboard daily within 3 months of launch.

## 3. Scope
**In-Scope Features:**  
- Transaction ingestion via API or batch upload.  
- Real-time fraud scoring and flagging.  
- Dashboard UI with search, filters, and alerts.  
- Case triage workflow (assign, resolve, escalate).  
- Role-based reporting for managers.  

**Out-of-Scope Features (future work):**  
- Direct payment processor integrations.  
- Automated chargeback dispute management.  
- Full machine learning model training (initial version will use rules + basic scoring).  

---

## 4. User Stories & Use Cases
**User Stories:**  
- As a fraud analyst, I want to see flagged transactions in real time so I can act before fulfillment.  
- As a fraud analyst, I want to filter cases by score, payment method, and region so I can prioritize effectively.  
- As a fraud manager, I want trend reports so I can evaluate fraud patterns and team performance.  
- As an engineer, I want clear API documentation so I can integrate transaction feeds.  

**Edge Cases & Constraints:**  
- Transactions with missing or malformed fields must not crash the system.  
- System must support at least 10,000 transactions/day in MVP.  
- Analysts may have varying screen sizes; UI should adapt responsively.  

---

## 5. Functional Requirements
- **Must Have:**  
  - Real-time ingestion of transactions.  
  - Fraud scoring engine with thresholds.  
  - Dashboard with alerts, filters, and case detail views.  
  - Case management workflow (assign/resolve).  
- **Should Have:**  
  - Export of case data to CSV.  
  - Manager reporting dashboard.  
- **Could Have:**  
  - Notification system (email/Slack alerts).  
  - Customizable scoring thresholds.  

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Dashboard pages load in under 2 seconds.  
- **Scalability:** Support up to 100k transactions/day within 12 months.  
- **Accessibility:** Compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA.  
- **Security:** Enforce role-based authentication and encrypted data storage.  
- **Compliance:** Ensure GDPR compliance for handling user data.  

---

## 7. Dependencies & Risks
**Dependencies:**  
- Cloud hosting (AWS/Azure/GCP).  
- External fraud scoring library or rules engine.  
- CI/CD pipeline for deployment.  

**Risks & Mitigation:**  
- **Risk:** Delayed data feeds reduce dashboard usefulness.  
  - *Mitigation:* Implement buffer queues with retry logic.  
- **Risk:** Analysts may resist adoption due to learning curve.  
  - *Mitigation:* Provide onboarding materials and training.  
- **Risk:** Scaling issues with data ingestion.  
  - *Mitigation:* Start with throttled MVP, add load testing before scaling.  

---

## 8. Acceptance Criteria
- A transaction flagged by the fraud engine appears in the dashboard within 5 seconds of ingestion.  
- Analysts can filter cases by at least 3 attributes (e.g., score, payment type, region).  
- Managers can generate weekly fraud reports from the dashboard.  
- Case status (open, resolved, escalated) is tracked and updated correctly.  
- Authentication system prevents unauthorized access to case data.
